counterstrike 5v5 multiplayer fps (think about how many users will be playing)

made to look simple/retro, super hot style maybe (red v blu tf2 style lol) I will pick the models later
multiplayer but also a single player bot (ai) version too
competitive bomb defusal rounds, tie at 12:12 win at 13 (mr12), etc (maybe add deathmatch or some other quick paced gamemode)
csgo-like movement, with crouch, shift walk, bhop, etc.
guns and utility work like counterstrike with an ingame currency based on kills and rounds

might have movement differences and new abilities to differentiate the game from just being a copy (Think about this over the lab)
PUT A SPIN ON IT

	new weapons (rocket launchers, bows with grenades attached), 
	dashing? xray grenade + other util teleporting? 
		MAYBE make it more movement intensive (but bots need to be able to work)

feedback: it needs a spin to make it more unique (new abilities that aren't in counterstrike)
	  they gave orders of what I should work on first (focus on movement and shooting first)
	  multiplayer can be really hard maybe limit to 1v1 or so, less complexity
	  be careful with scope creep
	  bots can be added, but it might be too complex to implement bots that use abilities, maybe they stick to map traversal and aim/shooting


Order of what I should work on: 			get the first 2 elements working with models and animations, maybe have some early AI and/or GUI

	movement (cs style)
	shooting (spray patterns, spread, movement inaccuracy, etc) and (movement) abilities (the SPIN ON IT) (wallbangs maybe?)
	-- didn't mention models and animation
ai bots (navmeshing, then it aims, might be a bit too complex to get bots to use abilties)
gui implementation (health, weapons, currency, timer, score, who is alive, etc. Basically look at counterstrike gui)
make map (No pcg, I will model it)
multiplayer later in case of scope creep issues (it can be a pain to implement with more users, so maybe introduce as 1v1 or maybe 2v2)

reward with xp || skins (if possible, easiest choice might be unlocking recolours of weapons)

look at brief to make a report and whatnot
